  Make sure `siad` is running

- What is `siad`?

  Check the sia documentation

- I don't know how to set up siad or the sia UI wallet, how do I do that?

  Check the sia documentation.

- *You have to help me set up mining SIA*

  No I don't

- *Can you log in on my machine to configure my mining setup?*

  No

  I get this question at least once a day. Seriously, you can not expect me to set up and support everyone's mining equipment.

- I don't know how to get it working, can you help me please please please ?

  Everyone has his price, make me an offer I can't refuse so I don't have to continue answering `no` to this question.
